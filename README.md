# Python
A collection of Python algorithm implementations


Files:
- `GeometricShapes.ipynb` -> The implementation was done to enable operations on triangle and polygon geometries, facilitating tasks such as calculating areas, checking point membership within geometric shapes, and representing them within the program.
- `PointLineSpace.ipynb` -> Mechanisms enabling operations on geometry have been implemented, such as calculating the intersection point of two lines and measuring the distance between a point and a line, determining the equation of a line, checking point membership in a line, as well as translating lines and reflecting points relative to lines. Classes for triangle, point, and line were created.
- `Deep_Learning_Project` -> The goal: To compare the effectiveness of a classic CNN model and Transfer Learning (ResNet50) in the task of classifying hand-
written digits from the MNIST dataset, focusing on metrics like accuracy, training time, and generalization ability.
- `Machine_Learning_Project` -> Predicting Spam Emails with Logistic Regression, SVM, and Decision Trees.
- `Statistical_Modeling_Project` -> The document concerns a statistical modeling project that compares different parameter estimation methods in a logistic regression model, analyzing their effectiveness based on simulated data.
